TestChallengeDotnet - a test challenge for interview follow-ups
===============================================================

The purpose of this test is to picture your capabilities as a C#/.NET developer. The main goal is spelled out in the Main method of Program.cs file.

- Implement the TODO comments to the best of your ability.

- In addition, you should be looking at how to improve this program. The DatabaseUtil class doesn't need to be significantly refactored. But you may do so, as long as you preserve it's functionality.

- Fork this project, make your changes, then send us back the url.

This test should normally take no more than a few hours. You WILL be given another (quite different) test if you interview here, so please don't try cheating.

Good luck!
